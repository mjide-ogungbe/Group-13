Game Instructions and Rules:
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a fist), "paper" (an open hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The objective is to select a shape that defeats the shape chosen by your opponent.

Algorithm Explanation:
Start: The game begins by prompting the user to enter their name, establishing a more personalized experience.
User Choice: The user is then asked to pick one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. This choice is made through a user input.
Computer Choice: The computer randomly selects one of the three options as its choice. This randomness ensures fairness, as the computer's choice is unpredictable.
Compare Choices:
If both the user and the computer pick the same item, the game is a tie.
If the user picks rock and the computer picks scissors, or vice versa, the winner is determined by the rule that rock crushes scissors.
If the user picks paper and the computer picks rock, or vice versa, the winner is decided based on the rule that paper covers rock.
If the user picks scissors and the computer picks paper, or vice versa, the winner is chosen by the rule that scissors cut paper.
Declare Winner: After comparing the choices, the game announces the winner based on the rules outlined above.
End/Restart: The game then asks the user if they wish to play another round. If yes, it returns to Step 2. If no, the game ends.
Additional Notes:
The game can continue in a loop, allowing the user to play multiple rounds until they decide to stop.
Clear instructions are provided at each step to guide the user through their options and next steps.
Error handling can be implemented to ensure that the user enters a valid choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
This structured approach ensures that the game is both interactive and straightforward, making it easy for users of all ages to understand and enjoy.
